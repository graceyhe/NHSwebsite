Next, organize your ideas and write a proposal. Only 15 groups may start a TSP, and there may be no more than 6 people per group.

In the midst of all your hard work remember to document your project. Lastly, write a final report. If you work in conjunction with another organization or for another organization, please take an extra step and have them fill out a final evaluation.</td>
